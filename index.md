## About Me

I am currently an associate professor at the Beijing University of Technology. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019, where I was supervised by Prof. Yong Shi and Prof. Lingfeng Niu. Before that, I received my Master's degree at North China Computer System Engineering Institute. Meanwhile, I was also working as a project member at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences supervised by Prof. Tingshao Zhu.
